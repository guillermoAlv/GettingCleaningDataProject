Coursera: getting-cleaning-data Project
=======================================
An R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set

2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement

3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names

5.Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

Additional Info:

VARIABLES USED:

1.testData: table readed from X_test.txt

2.trainData: table readed from X_train.txt

3.totalData: result of bind trainData and testData

4.testSubj: table readed from subject_test.txt

5.trainSubj: table readed from subject_train.txt

6.totalSubj: result of bind trainSubj and testSubj

7.testLabel: table readed from y_test.txt

8.trainLabel: table readed from y_train.txt

9.totalLabel: result of bind trainLabel and testLabel
